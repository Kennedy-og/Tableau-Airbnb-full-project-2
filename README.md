## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data from 2016 to 2017 using Tableau. The goal is to extract 
meaningful insights that would guide an investor interested in purchasing and potentially living in the analyzed region.

The project involves data exploration, quartile-based sorting, revenue analysis, bedroom pricing, and zipcode-level comparison.

---

## Objective
This analysis answers key investment-related questions:

- When to invest (revenue trends by year)  
- What to invest in (average price per bedroom)  
- Where to invest (price variation by zipcode)  
- How bedroom count affects potential returns  

---

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/dataset-link)
- **Timeframe:** 2016–2017  
- **Key Fields:** Price, revenue, bedrooms, room type, zipcode, reviews, timestamp, ratings  
- **Note:** Quartile sorting was used (three out of four yearly quartiles) to better structure the analysis.

## Methodology
- Imported and cleaned the dataset in Tableau  
- Applied three annual quartiles for structured sorting  
- Conducted exploratory analysis with filters and parameters  
- Created calculated fields for deeper insights  
- Built dashboards focusing on pricing, revenue, and location analysis  

---

## Key Visualizations
- Revenue by Year  
- Average Price per Bedroom  
- Price by Zipcode  
- Bedroom Count Comparison  

**Recommended additional visualizations:**
- Monthly or seasonal revenue trends  
- Price distribution histograms  
- Ratings by zipcode  
- Listings by room type  
- Host competition analysis  
- Price vs number of reviews (demand indicator)
